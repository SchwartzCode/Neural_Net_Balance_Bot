v1 - version that 'worked really well' (99% sure the USB cord was partially holding it in place), also D gain was -500 I believe
v2 - first attempt with new battery
v3 - first attempt with new motors (I shredded a gear on one by accident)
v4 = can balance robot without USB cord attached when helped initially by human
v5 - tried to use Arduino PID library (was awful - it would only generate positive outputs which didn't work with my control flow at all)
v6 - looked into doing PID about just one input variable (angle of inclination, normally I looked at gyro data also)
v7 - tried squaring error term
v8 - adjusted alpha to 0.1, switched to conventional PID control (before was more P-D-D^2)
v9 - removed deadzone at small errors, used Ziegler-Nichols method to tune gains
v10 - minimal deadzone, hand-tuned gains by eye
v11 - trying instructables tuning method [https://www.instructables.com/id/Augmented-Arthropod-Self-Balancing-Mech/]
