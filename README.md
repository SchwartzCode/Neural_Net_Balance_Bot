# PID Controlled Pendulum Bot

I designed and manufactured this robot during the Summer of 2020. It can effectively balance itself on a surface indefinitely, but it was not as resistant to disturbances (i.e. getting pushed) as much as I would have liked. After some analysis, it became clear that the motors were only able to re-balance the robot from a ~15 degree error with no angular momentum.
